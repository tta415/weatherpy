# Weatherpy
This code collects weather information for randomly generated coordinates that are matched to the nearest cities around the globe. 
The citipy library is used to return city names from the generated coordinated, and openweathermap api is used to call weather data.
The purpose of the this notebook is to analyze sample weather data around the globe to see if there are correlations of weather characteristics
to the distance from the equator.
